## Abstract

I created a springboot application and hosted it within several clouds: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, and Heroku. The cloud hosted springboot Application features a home page and a "pseudo-login", allowing for any input which will take the user to an orders page. The user can see all orders which are retrieved from a MySQL database hosted by the same cloud host.
